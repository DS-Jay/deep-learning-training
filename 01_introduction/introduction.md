### **Deep Learning: Definition and History**

**Definition:**
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning involving neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). These networks are designed to automatically learn representations of data by transforming input data into a hierarchy of increasingly complex features.

**History:**
1. **1950s-1980s: Early Developments**
   - The concept of neural networks dates back to the 1950s with the work of Frank Rosenblatt on the Perceptron, a simple neural network.
   - In the 1980s, the backpropagation algorithm was developed, allowing for the training of multi-layer neural networks.

2. **1990s-2000s: Winter and Revival**
   - Neural networks faced a decline due to computational limitations and the rise of support vector machines and other methods.
   - Interest revived in the mid-2000s with the advent of powerful GPUs and large datasets, alongside significant theoretical advancements.

3. **2010s-Present: Modern Deep Learning**
   - Breakthroughs such as AlexNet in 2012, which won the ImageNet competition, demonstrated the potential of deep learning.
   - Since then, deep learning has seen explosive growth, with applications across numerous fields.

### **Key Differences Between Deep Learning and Traditional Machine Learning**

1. **Feature Engineering:**
   - **Traditional Machine Learning:** Requires manual feature engineering, where domain experts design features from raw data.
   - **Deep Learning:** Automatically learns features from raw data through multiple layers of abstraction.

2. **Data Dependency:**
   - **Traditional Machine Learning:** Performs well with smaller datasets, often due to the effectiveness of feature engineering.
   - **Deep Learning:** Requires large datasets to perform well due to its high capacity and complexity.

3. **Model Complexity:**
   - **Traditional Machine Learning:** Models such as decision trees, support vector machines, and linear regression are simpler and easier to interpret.
   - **Deep Learning:** Models like deep neural networks are more complex, often referred to as "black boxes" due to their lack of interpretability.

4. **Computational Power:**
   - **Traditional Machine Learning:** Generally requires less computational power.
   - **Deep Learning:** Heavily relies on GPUs and other advanced hardware for training.
