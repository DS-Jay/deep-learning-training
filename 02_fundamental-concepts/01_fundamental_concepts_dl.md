### **Fundamental Concepts in Deep Learning**

#### **1. Types of Normalization**
Normalization techniques are essential for improving the training stability and speed of deep learning models.

- **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the output of the previous layer by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation.
- **Layer Normalization:** Normalizes inputs across the features for each data sample independently.
- **Instance Normalization:** Similar to layer normalization but applied to each individual feature map in a mini-batch.
- **Group Normalization:** Divides the channels into groups and normalizes each group separately.
- **Weight Normalization:** Normalizes the weights of the neural network rather than the inputs or outputs.

#### **2. Types of Models**
Different deep learning models are designed for various tasks and data types.

- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN):** The simplest type of neural network where the input data passes through layers in one direction.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Primarily used for image processing tasks, leveraging convolutional layers to detect spatial hierarchies.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Designed for sequential data, maintaining a hidden state to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM):** A type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem, suitable for long-term dependencies.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU):** Similar to LSTM but with a simpler architecture.
- **Transformers:** Uses self-attention mechanisms, excelling in natural language processing tasks.
- **Autoencoders:** Used for unsupervised learning, compressing the input into a latent-space representation and reconstructing it.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Consists of a generator and a discriminator, used for generating synthetic data.

#### **3. Architectures**
Deep learning architectures vary based on the type of input data and the problem at hand.

- **Single Input:** Models that take a single input (e.g., image classification).
- **Multi-Input:** Models that take multiple inputs (e.g., combined image and text data).
- **Single Output:** Models that produce a single output (e.g., regression).
- **Multi-Output:** Models that produce multiple outputs (e.g., object detection with bounding boxes and labels).
- **Encoder-Decoder:** Architecture used in sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation).
- **Attention Mechanisms:** Enhances the performance of sequence models by focusing on relevant parts of the input.

#### **4. Layers and Their Use Cases**
Layers are the building blocks of neural networks, each serving different purposes.

- **Dense (Fully Connected) Layer:** Connects every neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer, used in most types of networks.
- **Convolutional Layer:** Applies convolution operations, used in CNNs for feature extraction from images.
- **Pooling Layer:** Reduces the spatial dimensions of the input, commonly used after convolutional layers.
- **Recurrent Layer:** Maintains a hidden state and processes sequences, used in RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs.
- **Dropout Layer:** Randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training to prevent overfitting.
- **Batch Normalization Layer:** Normalizes the inputs of a layer to improve training speed and stability.
- **Embedding Layer:** Converts categorical data into dense vectors, commonly used in NLP.

#### **5. Optimizers**
Optimizers are algorithms used to minimize the loss function by adjusting the model parameters.

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** Basic optimization algorithm that updates parameters using the gradient of the loss.
- **Momentum:** Accelerates SGD by adding a fraction of the previous update to the current update.
- **Adam:** Combines the advantages of two other extensions of SGD: AdaGrad and RMSProp.
- **RMSProp:** Divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients.
- **AdaGrad:** Adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing smaller updates for frequent parameters and larger updates for infrequent ones.
- **Adadelta:** An extension of AdaGrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.

#### **6. Loss Functions**
Loss functions measure the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values.

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Used for regression tasks, measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** Another regression loss, measuring the average absolute differences.
- **Binary Cross-Entropy:** Used for binary classification tasks.
- **Categorical Cross-Entropy:** Used for multi-class classification tasks with one-hot encoded labels.
- **Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy:** Used for multi-class classification tasks with integer labels.
- **Huber Loss:** Combines advantages of both MSE and MAE, less sensitive to outliers.

#### **7. Metrics**
Metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a model.

- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
- **Recall:** The proportion of true positives among all actual positives.
- **F1 Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **AUC-ROC:** Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, measuring the ability of the classifier to distinguish between classes.

#### **8. Model Compilation**
Model compilation is the process of configuring the learning process.

```python
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

- **optimizer:** The optimization algorithm to use.
- **loss:** The loss function to minimize.
- **metrics:** Metrics to evaluate the model's performance.

#### **9. Model Fitting**
Model fitting is the process of training the model on the dataset.

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32)
```

- **x_train:** Training data.
- **y_train:** Training labels.
- **epochs:** Number of complete passes through the training dataset.
- **batch_size:** Number of samples per gradient update.

#### **10. Model Evaluation**
Model evaluation measures the performance of the model on a separate test dataset.

```python
model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
```

- **x_test:** Test data.
- **y_test:** Test labels.

#### **11. Activation Functions**
Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):** `f(x) = max(0, x)`
- **Sigmoid:** `f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))`
- **Tanh:** `f(x) = (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / (exp(x) + exp(-x))`
- **Softmax:** Normalizes the input vector into a probability distribution.
- **Leaky ReLU:** A variant of ReLU that allows a small gradient when the unit is not active.

#### **12. List of Parameters**
Parameters are the elements of the model that are learned during training.

- **Weights:** The learnable parameters within each layer.
- **Biases:** Additional parameters added to the output of each layer to improve the model's fit.
- **Learning Rate:** Controls the size of the steps taken during gradient descent.
- **Batch Size:** The number of samples processed before the model is updated.
- **Epochs:** The number of complete passes through the training data.
