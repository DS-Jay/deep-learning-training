    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- **Epoch 1/5**: This indicates that the model is currently training on the first epoch out of a total of 5 epochs. An epoch refers to one complete pass through the entire training dataset.\n",
    "- **1875/1875**: The training dataset is divided into batches, and each batch contains a subset of the training data. Here, 1875 batches are processed per epoch. The progress bar `[==============================]` visually indicates the progress through the batches.\n",

    "\n",
    "The training and evaluation process shows that the model starts with a moderate accuracy and gradually improves over each epoch. By the end of the training, the model achieves high accuracy on both the training and test datasets, indicating effective learning and good generalization to new data. This process demonstrates how neural networks can be trained to perform classification tasks with high accuracy through iterative learning and evaluation."
